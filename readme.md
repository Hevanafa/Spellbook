A word unscrambler utility that can help with some word games that involve scrambled letters

This project is a remake of my older Spellbook written in C# from April 2020, now written in Object Pascal with Lazarus

## Requirements

- Lazarus IDE v3.6

### Online Packages

- [RichMemo](https://wiki.freepascal.org/RichMemo) widget
- BGRAControls

## Building

- Open `project.lpi` with Lazarus
- Change the build mode to **Release**
- Click **Run** (also by pressing `F9`)

## Credits

- The word list uses `TWL06.txt` obtained from [Peter Norvig's website](https://norvig.com/ngrams/)
- [Droid Sans Font](https://www.1001fonts.com/droid-sans-font.html)
